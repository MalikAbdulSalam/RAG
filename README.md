# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PDF Integration

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for querying PDF documents using **Groq AI** and **LangChain**. The system utilizes a PyQt5-based GUI, which allows users to interact with the system, browse and upload PDFs, and query the documents for responses generated by a Groq-powered language model.

## Features
- **PDF Upload & Processing:** Upload a PDF and parse it using LangChain's document loader to prepare the document for querying.
- **Interactive Querying:** Users can input a query, and the system retrieves relevant information from the PDF using vector-based retrieval and generates an answer using the Groq language model.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system provides real-time feedback on the PDF compilation status and displays responses generated by the model.
